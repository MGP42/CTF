# Description
This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!<br>
Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}".
# Provided
- [cyphertext](407-cyphertext)
- [convert.py](407-convert.py)
  
# Progress
I started with the `cyphertext`. It contains nothing but the cypher itself. So for now the file is useless.

The `convert.py` cotains the interesting stuff:
``` python
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur
```

This provides some relevant information. The problem here is that the every cycle is using the state of the cycle before.
I now knew that i couldn't decrypt the cypher start to finish but actually have to inverse it first.

To decode i came up with:
``` python
m=m[::-1]
for char in m:
  out+=lookup1[prev]
  cur=lookup2.index(char)
  prev=(prev-cur)%40
```
the problem is that i did not know what i should initialize `prev` with. I know what the encoder started with, but i did not know what it ended with.
What i did know is that the value had to be between 0 and 39. So bruteforcing was definitely an option.

I came up with the following:
``` python
for i in range(0,40):
  prev=i
  cur=0
  for char in m:
    cur=lookup2.index(char)
    prev=(prev-cur)%40
  if prev==0:
    prev=i
    break
```
Here i removed the `out+=lookup1[prev]` from the original loop as i do not care about 39 false decyphered strings. I wrapped the entire thing in a loop and added a break when reaching `prev==0`<br>
This left me with a prev value of 0.... Coincidence??

At this point i got distracted a little while cause i had the feeling this could be solved without bruteforcing. This led me to the following:
```  python
prev=decode_prev
cur=0

for char in m:
  cur=lookup2.index(char)
  prev=(prev-cur)%40

prev=(40-prev+org_prev+decode_prev)%40
```
To shorten this slightly i set the `decode_prev` to 0
```  python
prev=0
cur=0

for char in m:
  cur=lookup2.index(char)
  prev=(prev-cur)%40

prev=(40-prev+org_prev)%40
```
I do not know why this works yet, but it does and i wanted to get back to the task at hand.<br>
I added the decoding routine back in and finished the script:
``` python
m="DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

def decrypt(m):
  global lookup1
  global lookup2
  m=m[::-1]

  prev=0
  out=""
  cur=0

  for char in m:
    cur=lookup2.index(char)
    prev=(prev-cur)%40

  prev=(40-prev)%40
  cur=0

  for char in m:
    out+=lookup1[prev]
    cur=lookup2.index(char)
    prev=(prev-cur)%40

  print(out[::-1])

decrypt(m)
```
I got the result:
``` python
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
I copied that in a new script and tried to execute it which instantly produced:
``` python
File "/home/runner/shuffle-crack/why.py", line 14
  print chars[i] #prints
```
Right... Python2... As the comment already points out. As i haven't had the option to get a Version of Python2 at that time (don't ask), i converted it to python 3 instead:
``` python
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1
for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print (chars[i]) #prints
        b += 1
```
Considering the comment selfinput, i decided to throw the file in itself again and got:
```
a
d
l
i
b
s
```
As the description already states i wouldn't get the usual kind of flag so i put the wrapper around it and got the flag:
```picoCTF{adlibs}```

# Analyse
I implemented an encrypt and a decrypt routine. To play around a little bit.
The decrypt routine being the one i used previously and the encrypt routine i just copied from the `convert.py`

Looking at the encrypt part:
``` python
prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur
  print(prev)
```
the initial prev does not get fed back in the routine. It only gets used once. This means that only the first letter should change!<br>
To check this i wrote a short loop:
``` python
for prev in range (0,40):
  chars="helloworld"
  out = ""
  for char in chars:
    cur = lookup1.index(char)
    out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
    prev = cur
  print(out)
```
resulting:
```
brHADImDom
arHADImDom
TrHADImDom
SrHADImDom
RrHADImDom
QrHADImDom
...
```
As expected only the first character changes. <br>
This also means that the prev at the end always is the exact same. No matter the input prev.

So why does even `prev=(40-prev)%40` for a start value of 0 works?<br>
First of all the statement is bloated: `%40` is useless as prev can only be 0-39. An alternative would have been `-prev%40`.<br>
Secondly changing prev only shifts the decryption in the oposite direction which means for a value of 0 40-prev works just fine.

When the original prev is something that isn't 0 the entire string gets shifted to far as the prev_decode becomes bigger than it's supossed to.
Which has to be counteracted by adding the value back in. Same goes for the start prev of the decode algorithm.

Using the Discovery that only the first character changes based on the original prev the decryption algorithm can be changed to:
``` python
m=m[::-1]
out=""  
prev=40-lookup2.index(m[0])+1

for char in m:
  out+=lookup1[prev]
  cur=lookup2.index(char)
  prev=(prev-cur)%40

print(out[::-1])
```
This way the initial prev does not take a role in the decryption algorithm.
