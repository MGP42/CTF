8 digits characters, that's indeed very small...

How about a [Factorization Calculator](https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM)? Not going to do that myself.<br>
It says 6 Minutes, guess I will make some Tea.

Took it 9 Minutes, but who am I going to complain...

I could calculate that myself now, but I'm feeling lazy, so I will use a [Decipher](https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher)

Error 0? Fine.... I do it myself -_-

For some reason, I decided to do it properly and went completely overkill for the task at hand.
Long story short, there is no an entire [python GUI](../../Tools/RSA%20Calculator.py). If I get bored enough I might even make it so values can be fed directly from console...

Anyway, I threw my values in the Tool and got the flag:
```
picoCTF{sma11_N_n0_g0od_23540368}
